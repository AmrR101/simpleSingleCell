Description: 
        Once a proud workflow package, this is now a shell of its former self.
        Almost all of its content has been cannibalized for use in the
        "Orchestrating Single-Cell Analyses with Bioconductor" book at
        https://osca.bioconductor.org. Most vignettes here are retained as
        reminders of the glory that once was, also providing redirection for
        existing external links to the relevant OSCA book chapters. The final
        task of this package - and perhaps its greatest indignity! - is to
        act as a vessel for compiling its successor on the Bioconductor build
        system.
