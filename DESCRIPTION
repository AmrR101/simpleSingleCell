Description: 
        Almost all content that was previously in these workflows have been
        migrated to the "Orchestrating Single-Cell Analyses with Bioconductor"
        book at https://osca.bioconductor.org. Most vignettes here are retained
        largely for back-compatibility with existing external links, and
        provide links to the relevant OSCA book chapters.
